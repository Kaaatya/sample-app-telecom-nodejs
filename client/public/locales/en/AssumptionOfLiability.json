The information will be used to create two Signers for the envelope. We add a PDF document to the envelope and create SignHere tabs and Text tabs for each recipient.</p><h5>Step 2</h5>Using the <a href=\"https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/create/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Envelopes:create</a> API method, create and immediately send the envelope with the envelope definition made from the previous step. The returned <code>envelopeId</code> is then stored for use in the next step.</p><h5>Step 3</h5>To enable embedded signing within the app, call the <a href=\"https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopeviews/createrecipient/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EnvelopeViews:createRecipient</a> API method with the <code>envelopeId</code> from the previous step and a return URL to this application. This method then generates a signing URL for the signer, to which the user is redirected.</p><h5>Step 4</h5>After the user completes signing the envelope in the embedded signing session, the envelope is redirected to the second signer by SMS delivery."
