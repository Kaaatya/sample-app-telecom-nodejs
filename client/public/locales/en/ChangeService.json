Depending on how many accounts are changing, we ask the user to input a name and email address for the number of accounts specified.</p><h5>Step 2</h5>Using the <a href=\"https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/bulkenvelopes/bulksend/createbulksendlist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BulkSend: createBulkSendList</a> API method, we build a list of contacts that will receive the bulk envelopes.</p><h5>Step 3</h5>Create the envelope definition. Create a document from a PDF and add it to the envelope. Add a placeholder Signer to the envelope that will later be replaced by the recipients in the bulk list that you created in the previous step. Place tabs in the document using anchor strings.</p><h5>Step 4</h5>Initiate bulk sending to send the envelope to the recipients with <a href=\"https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/bulkenvelopes/bulksend/createbulksendrequest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BulkSend: createBulkSendRequest</a>."
